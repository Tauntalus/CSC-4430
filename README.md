# ExTowers
Welcome! 

# What Is ExTowers?
ExTowers is a personal project started in 2018, built to be a simple test of my coding skills, a small executable version of the popular puzzle game the Towers of Hanoi. The game supports a variable number of discs, with two different modes of play - a free mode, where the player is allowed to move discs unrestricted, and a constrained mode where only moves to adjacent pegs are allowed. The game is distributed under the MIT license.

# How do I play it?
Currently the only known way to play ExTowers is to install Qt Creator (https://www.qt.io/download) and to build it yourself. This is a known issue, and is currently being worked upon.
